<h1>Live Updates: Israeli Troops Push Into Gaza City, Forcing Desperate Palestinians to Flee
</h1>
<h3>By Lara JakesGabby SobelmanIsabel Kershner and Natan Odenheimer </h3>
<h3>Sep 16, 2025</h3>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people remained in 
    the city with hardly anywhere to go. 
    Israel said the ground operation, after nearly 
    two years of war, was needed to keep Hamas 
    militants from regrouping. </p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it had 
    launched a ground incursion into Gaza City 
    overnight, embarking on a risky operation to take
    control of a key urban area even as hundreds of 
    thousands of Palestinian residents remain there.</p>
<ul>
<li>U.N. inquiry: A United Nations commission investigating the war in Gaza said Tuesday that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians, the panel’s most sweeping findings yet about the Israeli government’s conduct in the conflict. Israel has repeatedly rejected allegations of genocide from scholars and human rights groups, saying the target of its military campaign is Hamas.</li>
<li>Humanitarian crisis: After nearly two years of Israel’s retaliatory war against Hamas, the Gaza Strip has been largely leveled and parts of it are experiencing famine, according to a recent report by the United Nations. More than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gazan health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.</li>
<li>Diplomacy: Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Tuesday that “time is running out” for a negotiated end to the war in Gaza. He spoke minutes before departing Israel for Qatar, and just as Israel was launching a military assault on Gaza City. It is unclear if Mr. Rubio knew at the time that the long-awaited ground operation had begun.</li>
