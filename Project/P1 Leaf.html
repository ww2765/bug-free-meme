         This dried leaf was found near the edge of the garden bed. Its surface is brittle and papery,
    the veins pronounced from drying — a small record of the season's late heat and wind.

        <ul>
           <li>Feels fragile yet comforting to hold</li>
        <li>Vein patterning like a map</li>
        <li>Represents seasonal change and the passage of time</li>
