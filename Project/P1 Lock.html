        <p>
         This rusty lock was discovered on the graden gate. Its metal surface is corroded 
    and flaking, showing the slow work of rain, soil, and time. But it is still functional.

        <h2>Why I Collected It</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>Its weathered texture tells a story of decay</li>
    <li>Symbolizes secrecy and forgotten histories</li>
    <li>Contrast between strength of iron and weakness from rust</li>
        </ul>

  <aside>
    <p>Fun fact:Rust is actually iron oxide, which forms when iron reacts with oxygen and water. 
    The process can even make a lock expand slightly.</p>
